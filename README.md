# Gamma vs Hadron Classification
This project aims to classify data from the MAGIC Gamma Telescope using different approaches, including standard machine learning methods (specifically XGBoost), as well as deep learning models such as Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks.  
The dataset analyzed was sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinand05/magic-gamma-telescope-dataset
