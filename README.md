# Gamma vs Hadron Classification
This projects will try to classify MAGIC telecope data using differnet strategies as standard ML methods, specifically XGBoost, Multilayers Perceptor and Convolutional Neural Networks comparing their performace.
The dataset analysed was downloaded from Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinand05/magic-gamma-telescope-dataset
