# Gamma vs Hadron Classification
This project aims to classify data from the MAGIC Gamma Telescope using different approaches, including standard machine learning methods (specifically XGBoost), as well as deep learning models such as Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks.  
The dataset analyzed was sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinand05/magic-gamma-telescope-dataset  

## MAGIC Telescope
MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov telescope), located on the island of La Palma, is currently one of the largest ground-based gamma ray telescope.  
It detects particle showers produced by very high-energy gamma rays (on the order of TeV), thanks to the use of the Imaging Air Cherenkov Technique (IACT). When gamma rays interact electromagnetically with the Earth's atmosphere, they generate secondary particle which in turn yield a new generation of $\gamma$ rays through bremsstrahlung. Any secondary particle traveling faster than the speed of light in the atmosphere emits Cherenkov radiation, which is captured by the telescope. Throght the detection of this light images, it's possible to reconstruct both the longitudinal and lateral developmente of the electromagnetic shower, as well as determine the arrival direction of the primary gamma ray.
